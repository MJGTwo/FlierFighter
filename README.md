# FlierFighter

This project was completed at PennApps XVI. The main application allows a user to take a picture of a poster on their mobile device and automatically sync it with their local calendar. We also provide information regarding the venue of the event including what the weather will be like on that day and how far / how much it would cost to get a Lyft to the location.
